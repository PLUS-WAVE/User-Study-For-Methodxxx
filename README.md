# User-Study For Methodxxx

This repo is a simple user study for subjective evaluation of different algorithms (Method1, Method2, Method3) based on video comparison and ranking. It provides a web interface for users to rank videos, collects results, and offers scripts for result analysis and video compression.

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

The backend requires Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 2. Start the Server

Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will listen on `0.0.0.0:5000`. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the user study page.

### 3. Organize Video Files

- `videos/original/`: Original videos
- `videos/Method1/`, `videos/Method2/`, `videos/Method3/`: Videos generated by each algorithm. Filenames must match those in `original/`.

### 4. Add Videos to the User Study

- To add a new video for evaluation, add the video file (e.g., `your_video_name.mp4`) to all four folders: `videos/original/`, `videos/Method1/`, `videos/Method2/`, and `videos/Method3/`. The filenames must be identical in all folders.
- Then, edit the `videoNameList` array in `index.html` and add the video name (without the `.mp4` extension) to the list. The order of `videoNameList` determines the display order on the web page.

**Note:** The names in `videoNameList` must exactly match the filenames (without extension) in the video folders, and the order in `videoNameList` is the order in which the cases are shown to users.

### 5. Result Analysis

To analyze all user results, run:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

This will print the ranking distribution for each algorithm and case.

### 6. Video Compression (Optional)

To batch compress and resize videos, use:

```bash
python compress.py
```

You can adjust compression quality and scaling factor in the script.

## Simple Server Deployment Guide
Refer to [My Blog](https://plus-wave.github.io/experience/21d156j9/)
1. **Install nginx** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Edit nginx configuration**:
    Open the nginx configuration file:
   
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```
   
    Replace the `server` block with the following (adjust the `root` path as needed):
   
   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
        server_name your_server_ip_or_domain;
   
       root /home/User-Study-For-Methodxxx;
        index index.html;
   
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
   
       location /save_result {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/save_result;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```
   
3. **Restart nginx:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

**Test:** 
Visit `http://your_server_ip/` in your browser. You should see the `index.html` page.

## Notes

- Ensure all video files are present and named consistently across all method folders and `original/`.
- Results are saved in `user_results/`; back up regularly if needed.
